# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

## Overview
Welcome to my Data Science and Machine Learning portfolio. This repository is designed to showcase my understanding and skills in both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques through detailed theoretical explanations and practical implementations. The repository serves as a final project submission for INDE 577, demonstrating comprehensive application skills essential for any aspiring data scientist.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into two main directories, each focusing on different types of learning algorithms:

### 1. Supervised Learning

In this section, you will find detailed examples and implementations of various supervised learning algorithms, including:
The Perceptron
- The Perceptron
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees / Regression Trees
- Random Forests
- Other Ensemble Methods, including Boosting

Each algorithm folder contains a `README.md` providing theoretical insights and practical applications, along with a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the algorithm on a selected dataset.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning

This section covers algorithms used in unsupervised learning scenarios, such as:

- K-Means Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Image Compression with the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

Similar to the supervised section, each algorithm includes a detailed `README.md` and a practical implementation in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Purpose of the Repository

The primary purpose of this repository is to:
- Demonstrate a deep understanding of various machine learning algorithms.
- Provide practical examples of data preprocessing, algorithm implementation, and result analysis.
- Highlight the significance of machine learning techniques in solving real-world problems.

## Navigation Instructions

Each folder in this repository is structured to guide you smoothly through different algorithms. Start from the main directories (Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning) and dive deeper into specific algorithms through the subdirectories.

Each algorithm folder contains:
- A README.md file with theoretical background and practical explanations.
- A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the algorithm on a selected dataset.
